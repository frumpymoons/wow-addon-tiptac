# TipTac fixed for Shadowlands

Based on the [comments in the curse addon page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tip-tac#comments) I incorporated
the changes done by the user _Architekt909_ and _Vilogity_ in this repo in order to track the changes done
to the original addon.

## Installing this version of the addon

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/frumpymoons/wow-addon-tiptac/releases), open or extract the zip and copy&paste the TipTac folder to the Interface/AddOns folder of the game. Make sure there is only one folder starting with the name TipTac in Interface/AddOns.
